# Extra_Delivery_Charges_Fraud

#### Business Scenario
You are a data analyst and have a large ecommerce company in India (letâ€™s call it X) as a client.
X gets a few thousand orders via their website on a daily basis and they have to deliver them as
fast as they can. For delivering the goods ordered by the customers, X has tied up with multiple
courier companies in India who charge them some amount per delivery.
